## 🎯 EARLY VALUE DETECTION

### Games with Potential Edge (Preliminary)

#### HIGH INTEREST (5%+ potential edge)
1. **Colts +7.5 vs Lions**
   - Colts 8-2, off bye week
   - Lions struggled outdoors in Philly
   - Dome game favors Colts offense
   - Market overreaction to Lions brand

   - Panthers showed fight recently
   - Potential middle opportunity

#### MEDIUM INTEREST (3-5% potential edge)
1. **Steelers +7.5 @ Browns**
   - Division game, big number
   - If Rodgers plays, value on PIT
   - Browns 2-8, questionable motivation
   - Thursday night unders hitting

2. **49ers +2.5 @ Packers**
   - Purdy back, offense clicking
   - Packers 3-7 ATS (30% cover rate)
   - Revenge spot from playoffs
   - Weather could be factor
