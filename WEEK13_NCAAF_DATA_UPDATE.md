## 💡 BILLY WALTERS NCAAF PRINCIPLES

While Billy Walters focused primarily on NFL, his principles apply:

1. **Information is everything** - College has more inefficiencies
2. **Motivation matters more** - 18-22 year olds vs professionals
3. **Weather impacts are larger** - Less experienced players
4. **Coaching mismatches** - Bigger talent gaps
5. **Situational spots** - Look-ahead, sandwich, revenge
6. **Line shopping critical** - More variance between books
7. **Smaller edges acceptable** - 4% minimum vs 5.5% NFL
8. **Focus on conferences you know** - Specialization helps
