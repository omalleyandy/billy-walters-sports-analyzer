# Archived Reports

These reports are still part of the permanent record, but they are infrequently referenced during day-to-day development. Moving them here keeps `docs/reports/` focused on the handful of artifacts we reach for every week.

- Files retain their original names so existing links are easy to update (just prefix with `reports/archive/`).
- `python scripts/organize_docs.py` performs the move automatically; use `--skip-archive` if you want to keep a report in the primary folder temporarily.
- Feel free to continue editing any document in this folder—archived does **not** mean read-only.

If you create a new investigation report that you expect to reference frequently, keep it in `docs/reports/` and add a mention to `docs/README.md`. When it naturally ages out, re-run the organizer to send it to this archive.
