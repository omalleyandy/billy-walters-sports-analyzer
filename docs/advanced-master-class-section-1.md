# Master Class – Sports Wagering

I didn’t realize it then, but when I went broke the first time in my life—betting on the 1955 World Series at the age of nine with the Munfordville town grocer—I was taking the first step toward preparing me to write this chapter. Welcome to my master class for sports betting.

From that moment until now, I have been through more trials and tribulations than anyone could ever imagine. It’s safe to say that, over the course of my sixty-plus years of betting, I have wagered billions of dollars (yes, billions).

I also have spent countless millions of dollars trying to stay ahead of the game. If we had not updated our computer models and I hadn’t reinvented how I think about sports at least fifty different times, I would have been out of business way back during the Reagan administration.

The truth is, until I decided to write this book, I would not have taken $20 million to share the details of my system. Friends ask me why I’d want to give away my secrets now. The simple answer is I’m not getting any younger and I want to give something back to sports fans. I could write entire books about strategies and variables and databases and percentages, but I’ve tried to distill everything that I’ve learned into the next two chapters.

### Master Class

This chapter outlines my core principles and discusses the three key elements of successful sports betting: handicapping, betting strategy, and money management.

The following chapter dives deep into each of those elements. It includes charts and numbers that I’ve never shared before.

I want to say up front: I’m sharing details about *my* system. Your model can be what you want it to be. But there are bedrock principles of sports wagering that are important to know regardless of the specific system you use or the size of your wagers.

Also, while the next two chapters focus on the NFL, the methods outlined here can be applied to any sport. Over the course of my career, I’ve handicapped and bet nearly every sport. And I’ve been successful at it by following the guidelines that follow.

### The Basics

It wasn’t long ago that Nevada was the only place in America where you could make a legal sports wager. Now the sports-betting world is more competitive and complicated than ever, thanks to the emergence of BetMGM, DraftKings, FanDuel, Caesars, Circa, Pinnacle, and a host of other sites and mobile apps—none of which, I can assure you, exist to help you win.

And winning isn’t easy: the odds are stacked against you from the start.

Let me start out with the absolute basics: there generally are many ways to bet, but the main one is spread betting.

In a spread bet, the score matters. For example, the Tampa Bay Bucs are favored by 7.5 points against the New Orleans Saints. You can either take Tampa Bay at -7.5 (which means they have to win by 8 points or more for you to win the bet) or New Orleans at +7.5 (which means they have to either lose by 7 points or fewer, or win the game, for you to win the bet). In either case, you generally must…

…pay an additional 10 percent to make the bet. So a $100 wager will cost you $110. This is called the “juice” or the “vig,” from the Russian/Yiddish word *vigorish.*

Because you have to pay that extra $10, it means you’ll need to win 52.38 percent of the time to break even.

Here’s another way of putting it: even if you pick winners half the time after laying $110 to win $100, you will only get back 95.4 percent of your money—because you have to pay the bookmaker. Consider you place two bets, laying $110/$100 for a total investment of $220. With one loss and one win, you get back $210 on your winning bet (your bet plus the winning of $100) and you lose $110 on the losing bet. Bottom line: you win $210 on a $220 investment, which is 95.4 percent. This is worse than most slot machines, which on average return about 96 percent of the money played. The odds are even worse if you’re playing parlays and teasers, which we’ll explain later.

In a moneyline bet, you’re simply wagering on who will win. Moneyline bets are common in baseball, tennis, soccer, and other events where the scores tend to be smaller numbers, but you can bet the moneyline for any event.

Favorites in a moneyline bet are denoted with a minus sign. Underdogs are a plus sign. Let’s say, for example, the Tampa Bay Bucs are playing the New Orleans Saints and Tampa is a -180 favorite and New Orleans is a +160 underdog. If you like Tampa to win, you must bet $180 to win $100. If you like New Orleans, you bet $100 to win $160. The final score doesn’t matter—you win if your team wins. The bookmaker’s fee is baked into the numbers.

My primary message is that the average Joe or Jane faces an almost insurmountable set of disadvantages that virtually guarantee a significant loss over the long term unless you can flip the odds in your favor. I did that for thirty-six consecutive years, and I’ve developed a set of core principles for sports wagering that I’ll share with you now:

---

* Everything begins and ends with identifying value.
* Maintain an investment fund approach to betting.
* Only make big bets when the opportunity presents itself. Keep your bets to 1 to 3 percent of your bankroll.
* Time equals money—the more time you invest to analyze teams and opportunities, the better your chances of finding value.
* Stick to the facts. Avoid being a fan driven by emotion and loyalty.
* Understand the value of points. In football, the value of 3, 6, 7, and 14 outweigh other numbers—with 3 and 7 being the most important, simply because of the way football scores touchdowns and field goals.
* Understand the value of a half point in football. It’s been the second-most important factor in my success. (Handicapping being first.) A significant number of NFL games are decided by 2 to 8 points. If you can bet a spread with an extra half point, it can make all the difference in the world. Our team has mathematical formulas that show the actual values of these numbers, which I’ll share with you in the next chapter.
* Shop around to get the best prices. Set up betting accounts at different venues. Compare odds and prices. This is a must! Every cent matters, especially over the course of a season. The difference between winning and losing is razor-thin; make sure you’re getting the best prices/odds before you make your bets.
* Keep learning. I’ve been betting for more than six decades, and I learn new things all the time.

### Handicapping

Being a good handicapper is, of course, essential to being a winning sports bettor. I have teams of handicappers that develop power ratings for every NFL team—and ratings on every single player, in addition to keeping statistics on all of the important factors that go into a game. We make outcome predictions for every NFL game, just like the Las Vegas bookmakers. And I bet my opinion against those bookmakers’ opinion. My track record speaks for itself.

Many sports bettors do not have the time or expertise for in-depth handicapping, which is understandable. So use the resources that are publicly available, from ESPN to local newspapers. But here are a few key tips that every sports bettor should know.

#### Home Field Advantage

The standard NFL home field advantage, taking fanfare, folklore, and conventional wisdom into consideration, is generally thought to be worth 3 points. Well, not so fast. The actual average home field advantage, taking into account every NFL game from 1974 to 2022, is closer to 2.5 points. In addition, the home field advantage over the last four years of NFL football is actually less than 1 point (thanks largely to COVID).

If you had made the mistake of using 3 points for the average home field advantage over the last three years, you certainly would have lost. This is a variable that needs constant updating to keep up with trends. I do a lot of reading and examining scoring trends over time to determine exactly what advantage home field affords.

Also, the average home field advantage is different based on specific cities. Some teams enjoy extra special advantages due to geography (think the Denver Broncos) or weather (think teams built for the cold or hot weather such as the Green Bay Packers or Miami Dolphins). Overall attendance, the presence of rabid fans, the comforts of home, home field familiarity, and travel issues for the visitors are other factors that may also affect home field advantage.

### Prevent

Prevent is the tendency to relax defensively when holding the lead late in a half or in the game.

It is important to understand each team’s tendencies. Do they play soft with a lead or not? Does the coaching staff rest key players when the lead is big? Do they play prevent defenses when they’re ahead by double digits?

These are crucial things to study and understand. If you learn these tendencies, you will see that some teams are much better to bet on, regardless of whether they are a favorite or an underdog.

### Injuries

Injuries and illness can significantly affect a team’s performance. It is a hugely important factor in gaining a handicapping advantage. It is absolutely critical to know who is playing in each game, who is not playing, and who is playing hurt.

We closely monitor NFL injury reports and look at media and other sources for key information about the extent of injuries.

It’s also important to understand the terminology. Nothing is set in stone, but here are the NFL guidelines:

* Out: They won’t play.
* Doubtful: Unlikely to play. Significantly less than 50 percent chance they’ll suit up. This has changed with time; teams are more cautious about playing doubtful players these days.
* Questionable: You’ll hear this a lot. It’s viewed as a fifty-fifty proposition that a player will be on the field. And this is where you need to pay very close attention, especially if it involves a key player.

---

When handicapping for injuries, you must have a good sense of the quality of the backup. Will the team or the opponent adjust its strategy because of the injured player? If so, adjust your thinking accordingly.

You also have to factor in cluster or stack injuries. If more than one player at key positions are injured, it can have an exponential effect. I’ll discuss this more fully in the next chapter.

### Game Factors

We also consider many other factors that could affect an individual game situation. They include:

* Turf: Is the visitor playing on different turf than its home field?
* Divisional play: Visitors tend to play tougher in divisional matchups.
* Teams coming off Thursday night: The extra rest time often helps.
* Teams traveling and the distance traveled: Long trips have an effect.
* Consecutive weeks on the road: The second consecutive road game is more difficult than the first, and the third is more difficult than the second.
* Teams coming off byes: Again, a week’s rest may or may not help. It depends on the team.
* Teams changing time zones.
* Temperature differences: Warm weather team to cold.
* Rain, snow: Some teams do much better than others in adverse conditions.

All of these factors are listed and ranked in the next chapter. Remember, good handicapping is essential to successful sports wagering.

### Betting Strategy

After you’ve developed a handicapping strategy, it’s time to think about betting. But before you start betting, you must develop a betting strategy. The goal is simple: to get the best price. But getting the best price is not easy or simple. It requires some work. Here are some key elements of any successful betting strategy:

* Know all your options. There are multiple places to make bets—more legal places than ever before. And the number of bookmakers just seems to keep growing, with television networks and sports leagues working in tandem with gaming companies to promote sports betting.
* Don’t just bet with one casino or betting site—you’re a chump if you do. You need to shop around to get the best price. To be successful, you must be fully informed.
* Set up as many accounts as you can. Don’t be wed to the same bookmaker. Just be sure it’s legal and you are confident you can get paid.
* Familiarize yourself with betting resources. There are a few sites that aggregate information, pulling from hundreds of sportsbooks. I recommend five key sportsbooks every bettor should monitor, whether you bet with them or not. These market leaders—they post odds the earliest and take the biggest bets—provide a very strong indicator of how betting lines are moving, and knowing how the lines are moving is an absolute must in a betting strategy. They are: Circa, MGM, Caesars, Sports411, and Pinnacle.

* DonBest.com, Vegas Insider, and SpankOdds.com are industry aggregators, chock-full of resources for shopping prices. At these sites, you’ll see the opening lines, current lines, and differences in odds and pricing by different books, and you’ll easily see how the lines move during the day and week.
* Bet favorites early and dogs late. This is a general rule of thumb. There are exceptions, which I will explore later.
* Specific numbers matter far more than other numbers, and small percentages will make or break you over time. Bookmakers allow you to buy points, in half-point increments, to increase your chances of winning a game. You must know how and when to buy onto and off of points to increase the odds in your favor, but only if you can buy them at the right price. I have a few charts and some examples in the following chapter to help guide you.
* Understand the value of half points. The NFL season has 272 games. If you could use a half point for all those games, that would be 136 points over the course of a season. Getting (or buying only at the right price) that extra half point can make the difference between winning and losing. I’ll explain the strategy behind half points in the next chapter.
* Know when to bet the point spread and when to bet the moneyline. Always bet the one that includes the most value. I’ve included a very helpful chart in the betting strategy section of the next chapter that compares the moneyline to the spread.
* Be disciplined. Have a plan and stick to it. Don’t try to recover losses by making bets that are not in your plan. Chasing losses on Sunday and Monday night games is a recipe for disaster, just as betting the long shot in the last race at the racetrack to get even is usually a sucker’s bet.
* If the difference between your line and the sportsbook’s line is significant enough, this becomes a play for you. However, before…

…you bet, you must determine how much to bet. That will depend on the point differential and the value of the points involved. I’ve also provided charts in the next chapter that will show the value of each point, and the value of buying half points.

I bet at different times during the week. I bet early when I think I’m getting the best number and I bet late if I think I’m getting a better number. I’m always watching the key sportsbooks to see how the lines are moving, and I pay attention to key numbers and the value of those numbers. You’ll read more about that in the next chapter.

I cannot stress enough that, when betting, search not just for the best number, but also the best price. The industry standard is $110/$100, but you may find bookmakers with better prices. Pinnacle, an offshore, regulated bookmaker that is not available to U.S. citizens, offers $105/$100 on some bets. Over time, that lower price matters greatly. In a $110/$100 bet, you have to win 52.38 percent of the time. With a $105/$100, you have to win 51.2 percent of the time. That difference is significant.

### Teasers and Parlays

Parlays and teasers are popular wagers, especially among football bettors. They’re a little bit like the lottery—they offer a bigger payday, but they’re not easy to win. And the house loves them for one reason; they are much more profitable than a straight bet.

Because the house has the advantage, every bettor starts out at a disadvantage—that disadvantage is the expected loss, which is the amount a bettor would be expected to lose if placing a bet at the same odds multiple times, without the benefit of any smart handicapping.

In a straight bet laying $110 to win $100, the expected loss is 4.6 percent. Under the current rules in which a tie is a non-bet, a two-…
