## Money Management  

Properly managing your money is almost as important as handicapping and betting strategy.

The first order of business: sit down and decide what you want to risk. Start with the assumption that you’ll lose it all. The simple fact is you can’t play without a bankroll, so the top priority should be to do everything possible to protect the money you decide to risk.

With that thought in mind, I recommend that you set specific limits on how much you wager. Ideally, you should not risk any more than 1 to 3 percent of your bankroll on any single bet. This allows you to spread the risk and limit significant losses.

I like to bet in units. For purely illustrative purposes, let’s say you have a $10,000 bankroll and want to bet in units of $100, or 1 percent. So you’ve got one hundred units to start with.

I also recommend you bet in half units ranging from 0.5 to 3 units and the number of units you wager is based on your handicap analysis. For instance, you could assign a star value to each game—the higher your confidence in the bet, the more stars you’ll assign. Some games may be between numbers, so you should make a 1.5- or 2.5-unit bet rather than a 2- or 3-unit bet.

Most important: be disciplined.

## Taxes  

Last and certainly not least, there’s Uncle Sam.

As sports betting expands across the United States, we need Congress to start looking at some issues regarding taxation and sports wagering.

It’s my experience that some serious investors in the stock market want to bet—and bet big—on sports. But these people are not stupid. They’re used to paying 20 percent tax on long-term gains. In sports betting, you’re taxed as if your earnings are ordinary income. In 2023, that’s as high as 37 percent for a couple filing jointly, plus another 3.8 percent for a net investment tax. Add in state taxes and you’re at or above 50 percent in some states.

Also, you can’t carry forward any of your wagering losses. Under the current IRS tax code, losses sustained in real estate, stocks, bonds, or business can be carried over from one year to the next. Not so with legalized gambling.

One of the great advantages of betting in Europe is any money you win gambling, if you’re a European citizen, is tax-free. Countries like England have long realized that bettors, or punters as they are called in England, almost never win and betting on sports is as much a part of their culture as soccer. Legalized gaming promotes jobs and creates other forms of tax. They know the average recreational bettor has no chance of winning over time, yet they encourage gambling because it employs thousands of people, generates taxes, and provides recreation to citizens that is free of crime. They regulate it to make sure it’s honest.

As sports wagering becomes more and more mainstream, I certainly hope we see a more concerted effort to improve the tax laws for gaming. At least make it fair. Currently it isn’t treated that way because industry leaders have not done anything about it. State and federal governments will make their money by expanding customer participation and creating jobs and taxes on income from the industry.

## Awareness and Discipline  

Unfortunately, I do not believe the U.S. betting public is aware of this and I’m concerned there are thousands of bettors who are going to be getting surprise tax bills. The sports-betting industry needs to be more proactive in protecting its customers.

As I wrap up this chapter, let me make one thing abundantly clear: no system is foolproof. There is no magic formula to guarantee wins. You could follow every last bit of my advice and still lose. Above all, know your limits. As a former degenerate gambler, I cannot stress this enough. Hunt for value and be disciplined with your betting. I promise you this: if you don’t run out of money, you won’t run out of things to bet on.

## Advanced Master Class  

In the last chapter, I shared the basics of sports betting. In this chapter, I’m going to give you a deeper look at how I handicap sports. In doing so, I’ll reveal the secrets to my success, such as the value of certain numbers and everything that goes into creating a power rating. (We will again use the NFL as an example.) This chapter is not for the faint of heart—there’s a lot of math and statistics involved. You’ll see how much work we do to stay ahead of the game.

First off, I’ve been successful because I’ve worked with some of the brightest minds in the business, true geniuses when it comes to computer modeling and probability theory. For years, my proprietary betting models were built by teams of best-in-class handicappers, quants, and statisticians.

Over the years, my brain trust of more than twenty-five people has included a guy who was number one in his class at Caltech, a department chair of economics at a major U.S. university, mathematical savants, computer wizards, PhDs, and quantitative and database handicappers who live and breathe algorithms and theoretical angles not found in your average textbook.

Our team members act like hedge fund analysts, assigning a numerical value to every conceivable factor or variable capable of affecting sporting events to within a tenth of a point.

In the NFL alone, I have several teams of experts working independently. They have never met each other, even though most have worked with me for more than thirty years, funneling their information to one common denominator: me.

After more than six decades of sports wagering, I know the strengths and weaknesses of every player on my team, which allows me to weigh their numbers and ratings. Then, and only then, do I decide whether or not to make a bet.

### Power Ratings  

Because of the abundance of information on sports these days—and the ease of access to it—nearly anyone can develop a handicapping system. This would have been extremely difficult just twenty years ago.

The flowchart below outlines the specific steps for how my system works. You start out each season with power ratings for each team (step 1, labeled “Initial Power Ratings” in the chart), with game-specific factors (step 2), home field advantage (step 3), and an assessment of injuries (step 4).

Once you arrive at a game score prediction, you compare the prediction to the posted point spread (step 5) and act accordingly. Then the game is actually played (step 6).

After the game ends, you need to prepare for the next week’s games. This starts with creating new power ratings for each team (step 7). The repeat cycle is then in place—the new power ratings are combined with game-specific factors (step 2), home field advantage (step 3), and an assessment of injuries (step 4) to determine the next game prediction (step 5). This is shown in step 8.

Then the next game is played (step 9), and that information is used for the subsequent power rating. Repeat, repeat, repeat until the season ends.

## Sources for Power Ratings  

To begin, you can easily find some very good sources for power ratings in the NFL, college football, and other sports. In no particular order, they are ESPN, Sagarin, Goldsheet, Massey Ratings, Sonny Moore’s Computer Power Ratings, and Kenny White Sports. Again, these ratings must be in point-spread equivalent units. Most professional handicappers, including me and my team, assemble a new season rating by starting with each team’s rating at the end of the previous season. We then have databases that include values for each player, each coach, each draft choice. We use an addition/subtraction system—essentially a bookkeeping approach—to create a preseason rating.

Remember: in this system, everything must be in a point-spread equivalent value. We assign a point-spread equivalent value to every coach, every player, every division rivalry, etc. We then use basic math to arrive at a power rating. The power ratings then determine how we think teams will perform against each other.

Our power ratings generally range between +10 (think Kansas City Chiefs of 2022) and –10 (think Houston in 2022). The average team has a rating of 0. Good teams have positive ratings, weak teams have negative ratings.

Here’s a specific example: the New York Giants ended the 2021 season with a –7 rating (negative values are bad, positive values are good). The 2021 Giants were not very good. During the off-season, the franchise drafted well (+2.0 points), employed a new coaching staff (+1.6 points), had some acquisitions (+1.8 points), and we expected key players to improve in the 2022 season (QB Daniel Jones and RB Saquon Barkley). On the negative side, the Giants lost players via free agency, trade, and waivers that amounted to –3.9 points.

On the plus side: 2 + 1.6 + 1.8 + 2.2 = 7.6. On the negative side: –3.9. Net change: +3.7. So the –7 Giants gain a net +3.7 points in the off-season to start the season at –3.3. As you’ll read below, we then adjust that power rating every week throughout the season—for every team.

Each element of a successful handicapping system is important, and the smallest factors can make the difference between success and failure. These factors can play small, medium, or large roles, but they all play a role.

### Factors Affecting Power Ratings  

- Relative strength or power of the competing teams  
- Each team’s previous performances  
- Home field advantage  
- Individual values for each player on each team  
- Presence of injuries or illnesses  
- Game factors such as weather, schedule quirks, travel, stadium quirks, turf types  
- Motivational factors such as revenge, rivalries, coaching changes, etc.

## Relative Power of Teams  

The first variable to consider when creating a game prediction is the relative strength or power of the opposing teams, aka the power rating. You need to develop or find a power rating that is enumerated in point-spreads/game-equivalent values. ESPN’s NFL rating, for example, is called FPI, Football Power Index.

Two important conclusions can be drawn from this type of system. First, understanding the relative importance of past performance will be essential to predicting performance going forward. Second, it is essential to start with a good power rating for each team and that rating must be in points.

Most handicappers use similar logic to predict future performance based on past performances. The key assumption of this type of model is that more recent games are more important than games that happened in previous weeks. We calculate power ratings every week for every NFL team, using a formula that I’ll outline below.

These expected power ratings are numerical values and are directly transferable into point-spread differentials. Say the Chicago Bears have an expected performance (or power rating) of 10, and the Minnesota Vikings have an expected performance of 7. The Bears would be a three-point favorite. But you must adjust your raw power rating to account for the specific factors that will affect this particular game. Every game will have different factors that only apply to that matchup.

### Player Rankings  

You need to assign numerical values for all key players—offense and defense. In the NFL, that means keeping values for approximately 1,700 active roster players. It’s not as difficult as it sounds because at least 60 percent of NFL players have a near-zero value. That leaves approximately six hundred players with significant non-zero numerical values.

There are several potential systems for valuing players. For example, you could use the ESPN player ranking or the Madden player rankings. But, remember, a rank order does not produce a point-spread-relevant numerical value. You need to convert these rankings to be compatible with point spreads and power ratings.

Consider one such point-spread-consistent system. You could start by estimating the numerical worth of “star” players, identified by your own rankings or from published reports on top-tier players. Quarterbacks, for instance, are worth an average of a little more than a touchdown, with the best worth more. The best non-QB players generally rank between 2.5 and 3 points.

### Importance of Injuries  

It is absolutely critical to know who is playing in each game, who is not playing, and who is playing hurt. If a player is injured, but still playing, you would reduce his point value based on the extent of the injury. If the player is out, you remove his point value, but add back in a point value for his replacement, if that player has a point value.

Also be aware of stack or cluster injuries. Multiple injuries at key positions can have an exponential impact—and it varies by position and team. The most important non-quarterback positions for stack injuries are pass receivers (wideouts, slot receivers, and tight ends), defensive line, offensive line, defensive backs, linebackers, and running backs.

Let’s say the two top receivers on a team are injured. One is valued at 2.5 points; the other is 1.5. We don’t assume that their loss equals 4 points; because they are the top two receivers, the combination may be worth 50 percent more, or 6 points. If it’s a defensive lineman, you might only add 40 percent to it. And so on.

Regarding the importance of injuries and their effect on overall team performance, here’s a great example from the NFL: Tampa Bay’s offensive tackle Tristan Wirfs usually wouldn’t be considered a high-impact player. But when Tampa Bay met the Los Angeles Rams in the 2022 playoffs, Wirfs was injured and, because of the unique set of circumstances involving that game, his absence had a major impact.

The Rams, led by all-world defensive tackle Aaron Donald, had a ferocious pass rush, and Tom Brady was not the most mobile of quarterbacks. Wirfs, who we normally graded at 1.3 points or so in the regular season, suddenly became a lot more valuable because of his injury—maybe worth as many as 6 points.

Here’s why. With Wirfs out, his backup (normally worth 0.3 points) was also injured, but playing. Therefore, with an injury, he was worth no points. We knew the cumulative totals of that injury, along with Wirfs’s absence, were going to have a significant impact.
