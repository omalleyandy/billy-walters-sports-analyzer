   Status: ✅ Complete, Compiles, CLI Fully Functional

   Features:
   • Record new bets with ESPN predictions
   • Track opening/closing line movements
   • Calculate Closing Line Value (CLV)
   • Persist data to JSON (data/bets/active_bets.json)
   • Generate CLV summaries (win rate, ROI, avg CLV)
   • CLI: add, update-line, settle, summary, list commands

3. HISTORICAL BACKTESTING FRAMEWORK
   Location: scripts/backtest/backtest_espn_enhancement.py
   Size: 420+ lines
   Purpose: Validate enhancement on historical games
   Status: ✅ Complete, Compiles, Ready to Populate

   Features:
   • Load historical game data
   • Run baseline vs enhanced predictions
   • Calculate accuracy improvements
   • Generate consistency statistics

QUICK START (IMMEDIATE USE)
================================================================================

1. VERIFY ESPN IS ACTIVE
   uv run python -m walters_analyzer.valuation.billy_walters_edge_detector 2>&1 | grep "Enhanced"
   Expected: "Enhanced N power ratings with ESPN data"

2. RUN SPREAD COMPARISON
   uv run python scripts/analysis/compare_espn_impact.py --league nfl --show-comparisons
   Expected: Summary with average spread delta and improvement rate

3. START TRACKING BETS
   uv run python -m walters_analyzer.backtesting.clv_tracker add \
     --league nfl --week 12 --matchup "Buffalo @ KC" \
     --away-team "Buffalo Bills" --home-team "Kansas City Chiefs" \
     --pick "Buffalo" --opening-line 3.0 --size 2.0
   Expected: Bet recorded in data/bets/active_bets.json

4. VIEW CLV SUMMARY
   uv run python -m walters_analyzer.backtesting.clv_tracker summary --league nfl
   Expected: CLV statistics and performance metrics

5. RUN HISTORICAL BACKTEST
   uv run python scripts/backtest/backtest_espn_enhancement.py --league nfl --weeks 4
   Expected: Historical validation with improvement statistics
