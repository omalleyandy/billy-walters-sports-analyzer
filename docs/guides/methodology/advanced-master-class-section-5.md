## Parlays and Teasers

Now let’s look at parlays and teasers. Under current rules, “ties” are considered non-bets. That is, a two-team parlay in which one of the games results in a tie reverts to a single one-team bet. The bookies/casinos pay $90.90 for a winning $100 bet in those situations. In non-tie, two-team parlay situations a player must win both games (win/win) to cash a ticket. (The four non-tie possibilities are win/win, win/loss, loss/win, and loss/loss.) In this case, you are expected to win 25 percent of the time and a two-team parlay pays 13-5, so a $100 winning ticket means a positive $260. Under the current rules, a two-team parlay has an expected loss of 9.8 percent, significantly worse than a straight bet laying $110/$100, which has an expected loss of 4.6 percent.

A three-team parlay has an even worse payoff structure. In that situation, one tie means the three-team parlay reverts to a two-team parlay, and two ties means the three-team parlay reverts to a single-game bet that pays $90.90 for every $100 wagered. Under current rules, the expected loss from a three-team parlay is 12.4 percent, significantly worse than a straight bet laying $110/$100, which has an expected loss of 4.6 percent.

|                    | WIN % | PRICE | BET | EXPECTED LOSS (%) |
| ------------------ | ----- | ----- | --- | ----------------- |
| Straight Bets      | 0.5   | 110   | 100 | −4.6              |
| Two-Team Parlays   | 0.25  | 260   | 100 | −9.8              |
| Three-Team Parlays | 0.125 | 600   | 100 | −12.4             |

## Advanced Master Class

Teasers are parlay-type bets that allow you to move the spread by a certain number of points, thus the “tease.” They come in a variety of forms—two teams, three teams, 6-point, 6.5-point, 7-point. The bettor must win both games (i.e., win/win) to be successful and there are four non-tie possibilities (win/win, win/loss, loss/win, and loss/loss), so the bettor is expected to win about one-quarter of the time.

There is a perceived advantage in the 6-point (or 6.5-point or 7-point) teaser in that you get to “move” the spread by the teaser points (i.e., 6, 6.5, or 7 points). For example, in a 6-point teaser if the spread is 9.5, then you can bet the favorite and win if the favorite wins by any value greater than 3.5. Or, if you take the underdog and the underdog loses by less than 15.5, your bet is a winner.

Consider a standard 6-point two-team teaser with the generally accepted rule that ties are “no bets.” In other words, a tie in one of the games means that bet is no longer in play. No blood, as they say in the industry.

Being able to move the spread obviously increases the chance of winning a specific game. Each additional point increases the probability of winning the game by approximately three percentage points. A 6-point move increases the probability of winning from 50 percent to 68 percent. This is great, except that you have to win both games and you have to play the quoted spread in the second game. This compares to a straight bet, where you would have to lay $1.23 to win $1.

If you lay $120 on a 6-point, two-team teaser, the expected loss is 14.8 percent. That’s the same as laying $129.60. If you lay $130 on a two-team, 6-point teaser, the expected loss is 17.7 percent, which is the same as laying $134.60. As you can see, at current prices, the odds are stacked against you.

## Wrapping Up

I’ve provided a lot of information in the last two chapters. I hope you’ll find it useful. No one, I believe, has worked harder to build and cultivate a system designed to provide an edge in an increasingly complex game of man versus machine. If you’re committed to sports betting, put your mind to it and work hard at it. And good luck.
