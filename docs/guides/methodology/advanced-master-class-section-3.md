on the Bucs’ performance and the outcome of the game. Add the disappearance of wide receiver Antonio Brown, who had left the team weeks earlier, the loss of wide receiver Chris Godwin, and, therefore, the need for tight end Rob Gronkowski to stay inside to help block the pass rush, and I knew the Bucs were in trouble.

I wagered accordingly and won the bet, largely because I knew that an injured offensive line was going to change the dynamics of this game. I would have acted differently in the same scenario if the team had a more mobile quarterback or a stronger running attack. Again, these are the special situations in which you have to understand the value of each player, the quality of the opponent, and the overall impact on the score of the game.

We closely monitor NFL injury reports and look at media and other sources for key information about the extent of injuries. We have a software program that electronically scrapes social media accounts of key journalists and bloggers to know that information instantaneously.

For example, we monitor social media accounts of NFL beat writers; we pay attention to pro football medical experts Dr. David Chao (@profootballdoc) and director of physical therapy Edwin Porras (@FBInjuryDoc), who provide real-time injury analysis on Twitter. We closely monitor who participates in practices, Wednesday through Friday. If they’re practicing Wednesday, it’s almost a lock that they’ll play Sunday unless they’re injured in practice.

Some coaches have hard-and-fast rules, such as you don’t play if you don’t practice on Friday. You need to pay attention to the player and the injury as well as the coach. Know a coach’s tendencies when it comes to reporting injuries—there’s gamesmanship by coaches in revealing a team’s game-day lineup. We assign percentage values to injuries; a wide receiver with a foot injury is more likely to be affected than, say, an offensive lineman with a pulled hamstring.

Once you have a good sense of injuries, then you’ll need to adjust your player ratings accordingly. I provide a formula for doing

so later in the chapter. These ratings may adjust by tenths of a point or full points, but cumulatively, they are going to have an impact on the score.

Joey Bosa, a six-foot-five, 280-pound, game-changing outside linebacker for the Los Angeles Chargers, is a good example. When he’s healthy, Bosa is worth 2.5 points a game in our rankings. That can be worth changing a big bet to no bet or vice versa.

So how *questionable* is Bosa when he’s injured? We investigate all the sources above and then and only then do we start asking: Is his knee injury a full point downgrade? A half a point? A point and three-quarters? Is there a significant drop in his backup? These are essential decisions for handicappers.

Remember: quarterbacks are different, in that they are much more valuable than other position players. Therefore, it is important to create a quarterback-only ratings system. Both long-term and short-term performances metrics need to be analyzed.

Long-term variables that should be considered for each season, and career prior to that season, are:  

- The NFL quarterback rating  
- The quarterback’s total pass attempts  
- The average yards per pass attempt  
- Total interceptions thrown  
- Total yards gained rushing by the quarterback  
- Total times sacked  
- Total fumbles by the quarterback  

Other potential considerations when evaluating quarterbacks are the quality of the supporting offensive players, the strength of schedule, and the strength of each opponent.

What does this look like in real terms?

In our system, there are currently 991 non-QB players who have values that equal or exceed 0.10—this would be my group of non-zero players. The average value for these non-zero players is 0.63. Of those 991 non-QB players, only 612 players have values that exceed 0.25, which are meaningful values.

We have sixty-seven ranked quarterbacks in our current database. These QBs have an average value of 7.74, with a minimum value of 6.0 and a maximum value of 9.5 (with Kansas City QB Patrick Mahomes at the top).

Bottom line: About 40 percent of the players in the league have meaningful values. That’s why it’s important to understand injuries and player status.

### Game Factors  

Okay, let’s summarize. We are trying to develop a scientifically accurate prediction of an NFL football game. To this point, we have considered each team’s power rating (which includes player and coach values), home field advantage, and injuries/illness (which adjust player values depending on the injury and replacement).

Next, as outlined briefly in the last chapter, there are other factors that could affect an individual game situation: the expected weather, each team’s previous schedule (e.g., byes, multiple away games in a row, etc.), travel distance/difficulty, stadium quirks, and turf types.

For every one of these factors, we have analyzed historical data from 1974 to 2023 and created a point-spread consistent value. Each number in these factors is worth one-fifth of a point. So if the factors add up to 5, you will adjust your power ranking by 1 point. If it’s 10, then it’s worth 2 points.

Game factors are very important. These factors include S-factors (special situations), W-factors (weather), and E-factors (emotional).  

---

All these game factors are based on long-term statistical analysis and are defined below.

One important note: the numbers here are from the end of the 2022–23 season. These are not necessarily the exact numbers we’ll use in the future because we always reevaluate from year to year, upgrading, downgrading, or even eliminating some factors based on trends.

Most of these factors should be self-explanatory, with either the home team or visiting team benefitting from that specific factor. In those cases where you see “Variable,” you will need to know more about each particular team’s strengths and weaknesses to assess the value of the factors for that matchup. For example, very high winds in an open, outdoor stadium will hurt a passing team and favor a running team. High winds also are likely to reduce the total score.

These W-factors can also be dependent on quarterback performance. Each quarterback in the league is evaluated in a variety of situations (home, away, day, night, turf types, and weather conditions—presence of precipitation, wind conditions, and temperature).

These performances are evaluated at the end of the season and periodically throughout the season. W-factors are assessed where warranted. For example, Josh Allen of Buffalo gets +1 W for hot temperatures and dome games. Surprisingly, he loses –1 W for cold-weather games. Aaron Rodgers is the exact opposite; he tends to perform better in cold weather than hot. Each of the quarterback W-factors is worth 0.15 points.

**E-Factors**—These are emotional factors related to recent previous performance or unique playoff situations. For example, one team has lost two games in a row, or one team has playoff possibilities, and the other team does not. Each E-factor is worth 0.2 points. In addition to the examples above, the list of the relevant situations that receive E-factor consideration include: (1) coaching movements; (2) player movements; (3) the relative importance of the game for each specific team, as determined through an examination of the schedule meaning or as indicated by coaches/players; and (4) results history.

### Creating/Updating Power Ratings  

Each week, you will need to update your power ratings based on all the factors above. We use a relatively simple mathematical formula.

The new power rating is 90 percent of the old power rating plus 10 percent of what I call the True Game Performance Level. You arrive at the True Game Performance Level by calculating the net score of the last game and adding or subtracting that opponent’s old power rating and the net injury differential.

This may seem complicated, but it’s not. To help, I’ll share the following example. Let’s use the Bears and Vikings.

The Bears played the Vikings on a neutral field (i.e., no home field advantage):

1. Going into the game, the Bears had a power rating of 10 and the Vikings had a power rating of 4;  
2. The Bears had an injury level of 3.5 and the Vikings had an injury level of 1.7;  
3. The Bears win the game, 27–20.  

Before we figure out the Bears’ new power rating, we must determine the True Game Performance Level. It is calculated this way:

Net Score = Bears +7  

Add Opponent’s (Vikings) old power rating = +4  

Add Differential of Injuries (Bears injury number minus Vikings injury number): (3.5 – 1.7) = 1.8  

So the True Game Performance Level for the Bears is:  
7 + 4 + 1.8 = 12.8  

---

Now, go back to our Power Rating Formula: 90 percent of the old power rating + 10 percent of the True Game Performance Level. It looks like this: 90% of 10 + 10% of 12.8 is 9.0 + 1.28 = 10.28

By beating the Vikings, 27–20, and accounting for injuries to both teams, the Bears’ power rating goes from 10 to 10.28.

Now let’s calculate the Vikings’ new power rating.

The True Game Performance Level for the Vikings is calculated as follows:

Net Score = –7  

Bears’ power rating = +10  

Net Injury Differential (Vikings minus Bears injuries): [1.7 – 3.5)] = –1.8  

True Game Performance Level: –7 + 10 + (–1.8) = 1.2  

So the Vikings’ Power Rating Formula is 90% of 4 + 10% of 1.2, which is 3.60 + 0.12 = 3.72

By losing, 27–20, to the Bears, the Vikings’ power rating has dropped from 4 to 3.72.

The table below provides some additional examples. The key thing to remember is that, when creating a new power rating for a specific team, all relevant values must be from the perspective of that team. That is, the team’s True Game Performance Level receives positive credit for its own injuries, its opponent’s rating, and its net score. The team’s True Game Performance Level receives a debit for its opponent’s injuries. Once the True Game Performance Level is determined, then the team’s new power rating is a combination of the old rating and the True Game Performance Level.

Let’s look at the first example in the table. Remember, my formula is 90 percent of the old team rating + 10 percent of the True Game Performance Level. In that example, the True Game Perfor-

| TEAM RATING | TEAM INJURIES | OPPONENT RATING | OPPONENT INJURIES | NET SCORE | TRUE GAME PERFORMANCE LEVEL | NEW TEAM RATING |
|-------------|--------------:|---------------:|-----------------:|----------:|---------------------------:|---------------:|
| 8           | 4.7           | –4.2           | 6.5              | 14        | 8.0                        | 8.0            |
| 6.2         | 3.5           | 9.0            | 1.8              | –10       | 0.70                       | 5.65           |
| –4.5        | 3.8           | 11             | 5.1              | –8        | –1.7                       | –3.88          |
| 7.6         | 4.1           | 2.1            | 3.8              | 7         | 9.4                        | 7.78           |
| –2.8        | 1.9           | 6.4            | 2.8              | –21       | –15.5                      | –4.07          |
| 5.0         | 5.4           | 7.6            | 2.9              | 11        | 21.1                       | 6.61           |

mance Level is 14 (the net score) + the old power rating of the opponent (–4.2), and the net injuries (4.7 – 6.5 = –1.8). So the formula for the True Game Performance Level is 14 – 4.2 – 1.8 = 8.

Thus, the new power rating is 90 percent of 8 (7.2) + 10 percent of 8 (0.8) for a new power rating of 8.

Over time, you’ll get the hang of doing this.

For those still with me, let’s add in one more complicating factor. The earlier example (Bears vs. Vikings) was somewhat contrived because the game was played on a neutral field.

In actual practice, very few NFL games are played on neutral fields, with games in London, Mexico City, and now Germany being notable exceptions. This implies that for almost every game there is a home field advantage that must be accounted for in the True Game Performance Level. For purposes of these calculations, assume that home field advantage = 2.0. If the Bears are the home team and win, 27–20, then you subtract 2.0 from the True Game Performance Level to account for home field advantage. Similarly, if the Vikings are the away team and lose, 27–20, then you add 2.0 to the Vikings’ True Game Performance Level.

It looks like this:
