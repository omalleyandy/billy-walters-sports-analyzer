**True Game Performance Level Calculations**  

True Game Performance Level for home team Bears = 7 (score differential) + 4 (opponent’s power rating) + 1.8 (injury differential) − 2.0 (home field disadvantage) = 10.8  

True Game Performance Level for visiting Vikings = −7 (score differential) + 10 (opponent’s power rating) + (−1.8) (injury differential) + 2.0 (home field advantage) = 3.2  

**Resulting New Team Ratings**  

- Bears: 90% of 10 + 10% of 10.8 is 9.0 + 1.08 = 10.08  
- Vikings: 90% of 4 + 10% of 3.2 is 3.60 + 0.32 = 3.92  

Once you have updated the power ratings, you need to start thinking about home/away and other game factors that are likely to influence the next week’s score. Just as you did with home/away results, you should deduct game factors and injuries from each team’s power ratings as you head into the weekend.  

The number of factors assigned in a matchup can vary greatly. In the 2022–23 season, we assigned as many as 18 S-factor points to a team in one week. We also had matchups in which no factors were assigned. On average, we assigned 3.2 S-factors per team per week—which equate to an average power rating adjustment of 0.64 points per team for that specific matchup.  

**S-Factors in 2022–23**  
- Smallest Value = 0  
- Largest Value = 18  
- Average Value = 3.2  

Your final step is to adjust your power rating by adding or subtracting the point-spread equivalent game factors (5 factor points equal 1 point-spread point).

---

Then you compare the two power ratings. If Team A has a power rating of +3 and Team B has a rating of −2, Team A is a 5-point favorite in your system.  

### Betting Strategy  

After you’ve done your calculations and arrived at a predicted score, it’s time to think about wagering. I bet anywhere from five to ten games per week in the NFL season. But I bet only those games when there’s a large enough difference in our predicted spread and the quoted line. The bigger the spread between our prediction and the established line, the more I bet.  

You’ll also want to watch how other money is coming in—if it’s coming in for your team, you may want to increase your bet (by no more than a half star), or if the line moves significantly against you (watch the key bookmakers), you may want to reduce the size of your bet. Especially if there are a lot of injuries or morale concerns.  

It is critical you remain disciplined about managing your bankroll. As your bankroll grows, so does your unit price. Because unit sizes are in percentages (1 percent of bankroll, for instance), your unit sizes will automatically adjust based on winning and losing—that takes the guesswork out of determining how much to bet.  

Again, remain disciplined.  

### The Value of Numbers  

As I mentioned earlier, certain numbers are more valuable than other numbers when you’re betting football. We investigated number values for every game in the National Football League since 1974 and created the chart below.  

These numbers can change over time. For instance, if game rules change—extra points are now kicked from the thirty-two-yard line—

and more coaches go for two after touchdowns—then some numbers will become more important, some less important over time. As you can see in the chart below, the number 3 has the highest relative value—by far. It carries a weighted value of 8 percent.  

Think about that for a second. In mathematical terms, it means 8 percent of the time when the spread is 3, the favorite is going to win by three points. That’s more than any other number, so 3 is far and away the single most valuable number in NFL football betting. As you’ll see in the chart, 3 is relatively more valuable than 11, 12, and 13 combined, which are only worth 6 percent total.  

It’s important to understand the relative value of points, particularly as the spread moves during the week.  

If the underdog is getting 6.5 and you like the underdog, it’s best to wait to see if more money comes in for the favorite. The line might move to 7 or you may be able to buy 7 at an attractive price.  

### The Relative Value of Each Point, NFL  

(Chart showing Chance of Hitting Point Spread % by Point Spread 1–18, with peaks at 3 = 8%, 7 = 6%, 14 = 5%)

price—and that’s a big percentage advantage for you (6 = 5 percent, while 7 is 6 percent). If the line goes the other way, say from 6.5 to 6, it’s not as big of a disadvantage, so the risk-reward remains in your favor. And if you’re betting the dog and the number is 7.5, grab it as fast as you can—you don’t want the line to drop to 7. If it goes to 8, it’s not all that significant (8 is worth 3 percent, compared to 6 percent for 7).  

The opposite applies if you’re betting the favorite. Lay the 6.5 as soon as you can because if it goes to 6, you gain a small competitive advantage compared to what you have to lose if it goes to 7. Thus, the adage: bet favorites early and dogs late. Always pay attention to the value of the numbers as the line moves.  

### Buying Points  

You can buy points before the game to increase or decrease the margin your team must win or lose by. It’s a strategy I use, but only when I know I’m getting a fair price for those points.  

Here’s how it works: Most bookmakers will sell half points for an additional ten cents for every dollar bet, with the exception in football of 3 and 7. Some bookmakers charge twenty-five cents or more to increase the spread from +2.5 to 3. However, twenty-five cents extra to buy a half point to get to or get off of 3 is too high of a price. The table below shows you the right price for buying each number. If you can buy a half point for the amount in the table, or less than this amount, do it.  

Remember, one of the most important issues in buying points is to shop around—see who is offering the best price. If the price is not right—and this chart outlines the values—do not buy the half point. Stick with the original number. And choose the bet that provides the best value.

### Deciding Strength/Size of Bet  

Now that you’ve seen the value of points and buying half points, you need to decide how much to bet. I use a star system: the more stars, the more I bet.  

First, you identify your spread and the posted spread, then apply percentage values to each number contained in that spread. Consider the following example. Your handicapped spread is 7.5 and the posted spread is 4.5. Each point within that spread—5, 6, and 7 in this example—has value. From our table above, you see that the number 5 is worth 3 percent, 6 is worth 5 percent, and 7 is worth 6 percent. So 3 + 5 + 6 = 14%. In the table below, you’ll see that a 14 percent spread is nearly a three-star bet.  

If your projected spread or the posted spread is a whole number, you only count half of the value of that specific number. For example, let’s say you project a 4-point spread and the line is 2.5. In this case, you include the full value of the number 3 (8 percent) and half of the value of the number 4 (1.5). So you have a 9.5 percent spread, which equates to a 1.5-star bet.  

If the point values between your prediction and the posted spread don’t add up to at least 5.5 percent, then the bet does not qualify for a play.  

Another thing to remember: If you predict an upset and you have to cross the number 0, you need to deduct the value of a point. For example, if your predicted spread is +1.5 and the bookmakers have a line of −1.5, you do not include the value of +1. The values of the differential are −1 (3%) and +1 (3%), which would be 6% and worth a play. But because you crossed 0, you must deduct the value of one of the points (3%). So the actual value is 3 + 3 − 3 = 3%. That’s not worth a play.  

Here’s the table that shows our star system.

### Table 2 – Strength of Play Guidelines  

| Pick Minus Spread | Play Strength |
|------------------|--------------|
| 5.5% | 0.5 Star |
| 7%   | 1.0 Star |
| 9%   | 1.5 Star |
| 11%  | 2.0 Star |
| 13%  | 2.5 Star |
| 15%  | 3.0 Star |

### Understanding Line Changes  

Some bookmakers, instead of moving the point spread, will move the money on a game. For instance, rather than move the posted spread off of 3, they may charge $1.20 to win $1 for the 3-point spread.  

But what if the bookmaker decides to charge $1.20 for the 3-point spread? As you can see from the chart below, a 3-point spread at −120 really is equivalent to 3.25. When you calculate the differential between the posted spread and your line, you no longer can count the number 3 because it’s really 3.25. In our system, 3.25 is worth one-quarter of the value of 3, or 2%. Then include the number 4, which is worth 3%, and you’re at 5% and not worth a play.  

The opposite occurs if the bookmaker charges less than $1.10/100. At even money or $1.05/$1, certain spreads may have a larger differential and become worth a bigger play.  

In general terms, if the price is above par ($1.10/$1) for key numbers, you should reduce the size of the play. If price is below par, increase the size of the bet.

| 2.5 | −115 | 2.625 |
| 3   | +105 | 2.625 |
| 2.5 | −120 | 2.75  |
| 3   | 100 (even money) | 3 |
| 2.5 | −125 | 2.875 |
| 3   | −105 | 3 |
| 3   | −110 | 3 |
| 3   | −115 | 3.125 |
| 3.5 | +105 | 3.125 |
| 3   | −120 | 3.25 |
| 3.5 | 100 (even money) | 3.25 |
| 3   | −125 | 3.375 |
| 3.5 | −105 | 3.375 |
| 7   | 100 (even money) | 6.75 |
| 6.5 | −115 | 6.75 |
| 7   | −105 | 6.875 |
| 6.5 | −120 | 6.875 |
| 7   | −110 | 7 |
| 7.5 | 100 (even money) | 7.25 |
| 7   | −115 | 7.25 |
| 7.5 | −105 | 7.375 |
| 7   | −120 | 7.375 |

### Moneyline vs. the Spread  

Another huge consideration in betting is a simple one: Do you bet the spread or play the moneyline?  

The moneyline allows you to simply bet on the winner of the game and take moneyline odds rather than a point spread. Let’s say the Bears are playing the Vikings. The Bears are −158 and the Vikings are +120. That means the Bears are favored and you need to bet $158 to win $100. If you like the Vikings, a $100 bet will get you $120 if the Vikings win. The point spread doesn’t matter; if you’re betting the favorite, you are risking more money to win. By betting the dog, you’re not getting points, just wagering less money to win more.  

The table below shows how the moneyline correlates to the point spread if you’re laying $110/$100.  

To explain: If I like the underdog and I’m getting two points, that’s the moneyline equivalent of taking no points and getting +108 for a $100 bet. If I can get more than +108, that’s better than betting the spread and getting 2 points:
