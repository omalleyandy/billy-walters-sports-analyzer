- Track day-to-day NFL news: injuries, transactions, depth chart changes, role/usage shifts, and key matchup storylines that matter for betting and modeling.
- Track NCAAF FBS news: CFP rankings, rivalry week updates, major injuries, coaching moves, and any playoff or bowl implications.
- Emphasize items with clear modeling impact: line movement context, QB/skill position availability, OL/defense health, and macro narratives that could move sentiment or odds.
- NFL:
    - League/club-owned properties such as NFL.com news pages and team sites (e.g., nfl.com, teamname.com subdomains like panthers.com).nfl+3​
    - NFL Football Operations pages for rules, policy, and integrity-related updates.profootballwriters+2​
- NCAAF FBS:
    - NCAA.com’s FBS football section and related official NCAA pages.ncaa​
    - The College Football Playoff’s official site and releases, plus school athletic department sites for team-specific news. (CFP and most schools publish under .com/.edu domains managed by the organization itself.)
- Confirm the source and domain
    - Only trust feeds hosted on official domains
- Check feed security and validity
​- Verify account authenticity for social feeds
- Cross-check content and behavior
- Source and ownership fields
    - Domain and link fields
- Publisher/author identity
- Structural and identifier fields
    - Stable item identifiers 
        - guid (RSS) or id (Atom/JSON)
- Descriptive feed metadata
    - Title and description
       - title and description should clearly identify the official property 
- Integrity and transport metadata
- Protocol and security
    - Feed URLs should be HTTPS with valid certificates registered to the expected organization; HTTP-only or certificate mismatches are risk flags.
- Practical verification pattern for your stack
    - When onboarding or auditing an NFL or NCAAF feed, treat authenticity as:
        - Domain + link alignment
        - Consistent identity metadata
        - Stable IDs and structure over time
- Parse and schema-validate the feed
- Enforce domain and URL rules
- Parse all feed- and item-level URLs
    - Use a feed parser (Python feedparser, Node rss-parser, etc.) to parse XML/JSON
- Flag or reject items 
- Alert on patterns like:
    - Large proportion of GUIDs changing for previously seen URLs.
    - Many items sharing the same GUID.
    - GUIDs that are empty, missing, or look like random ad/tracking tokens.
- Cross-check canonical links and redirects
    - Issue HEAD/GET requests (rate-limited) for a sample of item link URLs and verify:
        - They return 2xx and eventually resolve to a page on the same whitelisted domain.
        - Redirect chains are short and stay within the league/team/school ecosystem.
    - Optionally, scrape the <title> of the target page and compare against the feed item title with a fuzzy match threshold to catch completely mismatched destinations.
- Monitor temporal and volume patterns
- Track over time for each feed:
    - Items per day/week, distribution of pubDate/updated, average lag between pubDate and lastBuildDate.
- Add anomaly detection rules, e.g.:
    - Sudden 10x spike in daily items.
    - Feed stops updating for N days during the season.
     - Many items with pubDate far in the past or future.
- These checks can run as a small job (e.g., daily) that logs metrics and pushes alerts into whatever monitoring stack you’re using.
- Build a test harness for onboarding/CI
    - For each new or changed feed, run a “health check” script that:
   -  Fetches the feed.
    - Runs schema tests, domain/URL checks, ID behavior checks (on historical snapshot if possible).
    - Outputs a pass/fail report and basic metrics.
    - Integrate this harness into the CI/CD data pipeline 
- Add official NFL/NCAAF domains to ALLOWED_DOMAINS
