Track Closing Line Value (CLV) - the key metric for betting success.

Usage: /clv-tracker [week] [action]

Examples:
- /clv-tracker (current week summary)
- /clv-tracker 11 analyze
- /clv-tracker season report
- /clv-tracker add BUF_KC -2.5 -3.0

This command will:
1. Track your betting lines vs closing lines
2. Calculate CLV (closing line value) in points
3. Measure edge capture rate
4. Generate performance reports
5. Identify systematic biases

Billy Walters on CLV:
"Winning bets is nice, but beating the closing line is how you know you're actually good.
Anyone can get lucky for a season. Beating the close for 3+ years means you have real edge."

Why CLV Matters:
- Short-term: Wins/losses are noisy (variance)
- Long-term: CLV predicts profitability
- Goal: Positive CLV = you're smarter than market
- Target: +1.5 avg CLV = professional-grade

CLV Calculation:
```
You bet: KC -2.5
Closing line: KC -3.0
CLV: +0.5 points (you got better number)

Result: KC wins by 3 (push at close, you win)
Verdict: Excellent CLV, good process
```

Billy Walters CLV Rules:

4. Judge your process by CLV, not results
5. If CLV consistently negative, STOP BETTING
