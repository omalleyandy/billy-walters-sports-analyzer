description: Document lessons learned, issues encountered, and solutions
---

Document a lesson learned from the current session.

This command helps maintain project knowledge by capturing:
- Issues encountered and their root causes
- Solutions and workarounds implemented
- Best practices discovered
- Technical decisions and their rationale

The lesson will be added to `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` with:
- Date and context
- Problem description
- Solution implemented
- Code references
- Future recommendations

Usage: /document-lesson

You'll be prompted to provide details about what was learned.

This builds institutional knowledge for future development sessions.
