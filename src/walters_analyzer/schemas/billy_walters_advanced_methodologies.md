# Master Class Basics
* Everything begins and ends with identifying value.
* Maintain an investment fund approach to betting.
* Only make big bets when the opportunity presents itself. Keep your bets to 1 to 3 percent of your bankroll.
* Time equals money—the more time you invest to analyze teams and opportunities, the better your chances of finding value.

## Handicapping
* Develop power ratings for every NFL team—and ratings on every single player, in addition to keeping statistics on all of the important factors that go into a game

## Home Field Advantage
* The actual average home field advantage, taking into account every NFL game is closer to 2.5 points

## Prevent
* Prevent is the tendency for coaching staff to relax defensively when holding the lead late in a half or in the game.

## Injuries
* It is absolutely critical to know who is playing in each game, who is not playing, and who is playing hurt.
* Out: They won’t play.
* Doubtful: Unlikely to play. Significantly less than 50 percent chance they’ll suit up. This has changed with time; teams are more cautious about playing doubtful players these days.
* Questionable: You’ll hear this a lot. It’s viewed as a fifty-fifty proposition that a player will be on the field. And this is where you need to pay very close attention, especially if it involves a key player.

## Game Factors
* Turf: Is the visitor playing on different turf than its home field?
* Divisional play: Visitors tend to play tougher in divisional matchups.
* Teams coming off Thursday night: The extra rest time often helps.
* Teams traveling and the distance traveled: Long trips have an effect.
* Consecutive weeks on the road: The second consecutive road game is more difficult than the first, and the third is more difficult than the second.
* Teams coming off byes: Again, a week’s rest may or may not help. It depends on the team.
* Teams changing time zones.
* Temperature differences: Warm weather team to cold.
* Rain, snow: Some teams do much better than others in adverse conditions.

## Betting Strategy
* overtime.ag/sports#/ is the sole source of betting odds to base judgement on for the opening lines, current lines, and differences in odds and pricing, and you’ll easily see how the lines move during the day and week.
* DonBest.com, Vegas Insider, and SpankOdds.com, Covers.com, espn.com,  are industry aggregators, chock-full of resources for shopping prices. Use these sites as a secondary barometer, to see the opening lines, current lines, and differences in odds and pricing by different books
* Bet favorites early and dogs late.
* Understand the value of half points.
* Know when to bet the point spread and when to bet the moneyline. Always bet the one that includes the most value.
* If the difference between your line and the sportsbook’s line is significant enough, this becomes a play

## Power Ratings
* start out each season with power ratings for each team:
	* (step 1) labeled “Initial Power Ratings” ,
	* (step 2) game-specific factors , 
	* (step 3) home field advantage , 
	* (step 4) assessment of injuries,
	* (step 5) compare the prediction to the posted point spread,
	* (step 6) game is actually played and game-specific factors,
	* (step 7) After the game ends,  prepare for the next week’s games. This starts with creating new power ratings for each team
		*repeat cycle is then in place:
			*new power ratings are combined with game-specific factors (step 2), 
			* home field advantage (step 3), 
			* and an assessment of injuries (step 4) 
			* determine the next game prediction (step 5). This is shown in step 8.
			* next game is played (step 9), and that information is used for the subsequent power rating. Repeat, repeat, repeat until the season ends

## Sources for Power ratings
* Power ratings estimate team strength using point-spread–equivalent units. Valid sources include ESPN, Sagarin, Goldsheet, Massey Ratings, Sonny Moore, and Kenny White Sports. Professionals build preseason ratings by starting from each team’s final rating from the prior season, then adjusting using additive values for every player, coach, draft pick, acquisition, loss, rivalry, or expected improvement. Every component is converted into a point-value so ratings can be summed directly.
* Typical team ratings range from +10 (elite) to –10 (very weak), with 0 representing an average team.
* Example:
	* The team starts with a base rating (–7).
	* All offseason improvements are converted into point values and added together:
		* 2 + 1.6 + 1.8 + 2.2 = +7.6.
		* All offseason losses are also converted into point values and summed:
			–3.9.
		* To get the net offseason change, subtract the losses from the gains:
			7.6 – 3.9 = +3.7.
		* Finally, apply that net change to the original rating:
			–7 + 3.7 = –3.3.
		* This new number (–3.3) becomes the team’s preseason power rating, which then continues to be updated weekly as new information comes in.
* Game predictions start with relative team strength, expressed as power ratings in point-spread–equivalent units (e.g., ESPN FPI, Massey Ratings). Power ratings quantify how strong each team is based on past performance, with recent games weighted more heavily than older ones. These ratings are recalculated weekly.
* Power ratings directly translate into expected point-spread differentials. For example, if Team A has a rating of 10 and Team B has a rating of 7, Team A would project as a 3-point favorite. However, raw power ratings must be adjusted for game-specific factors unique to each matchup.

## Player Rankings
* Player rankings must be converted into numerical point values that fit a point-spread power-rating system. 
* Most NFL players (~60%) have near-zero value, leaving roughly 600 players whose contributions materially affect spread calculations. 
* External rankings (ESPN, Madden, etc.) can help identify player quality, but they must be translated into point-spread-compatible values. 
* Star players get the highest values: quarterbacks are typically worth slightly more than a touchdown, while top non-QBs are worth about 2.5–3 points.

## Importance of Injuries
* Injury status must be incorporated into point-spread values. If a player is hurt, reduce his point value; if he is out, remove his value and add the value of the replacement (if non-zero). Cluster injuries—multiple injuries in the same position group—create multiplicative effects. Losing two top receivers valued at 2.5 and 1.5 points may be worth ~6 points instead of 4. The multiplier varies by position (WR, OL, DL, DB, LB, RB are most sensitive).
* Context matters: some players gain more value in specific matchups. Example: Tampa Bay tackle Tristan Wirfs, normally ~1.3 points, became worth ~6 points when facing the Rams’ elite pass rush because both he and his backup were injured. This compound injury significantly reduced team performance.
* Injuries can dramatically shift a team’s expected performance, especially when they weaken key position groups or disrupt scheme. Tampa Bay’s playoff collapse against the Rams illustrates this: losses at wide receiver, an injured offensive line, and a non-mobile quarterback magnified each other. Player value always depends on matchup context—injuries matter more when facing elite units (e.g., Rams pass rush) or when replacements are weak.
* Serious handicapping requires real-time injury intelligence. This includes monitoring official reports, practice participation (Wed–Fri), coach tendencies, and expert analysis from trusted medical sources (e.g., ProFootballDoc, Edwin Porras). Automated tools scrape beat writers and social media for early signals. Injury impact varies by position and injury type; each case is assigned a fractional point adjustment.
* These adjustments accumulate and affect spread predictions. Example: Joey Bosa is normally worth 2.5 points; injury downgrade requires deciding whether to reduce his value by 0.5, 1.0, or more, depending on severity and backup quality. Quarterbacks require a separate rating system due to their disproportionate impact, with both long-term and short-term performance metrics considered.
* Quarterback evaluation incorporates long-term metrics such as QB rating, pass attempts, yards per attempt, interceptions, rushing yards, sacks taken, and fumbles. Contextual factors—supporting cast quality, strength of schedule, and opponent strength—also influence a QB’s point value.
* Across the league, roughly 991 non-QB players have non-zero values (≥0.10), averaging 0.63 points; only 612 exceed 0.25 and meaningfully impact spreads. Sixty-seven quarterbacks are tracked separately, averaging 7.74 points (range: 6.0–9.5, with Mahomes highest). Overall, about 40% of NFL players have values significant enough to influence handicapping, underscoring the importance of monitoring injuries and player availability.

## Game Factors
* Game prediction requires combining team power ratings (including player/coach values), home-field advantage, and injury adjustments with additional “game factors.” These include weather, rest/scheduling quirks (byes, long road stretches), travel difficulty, stadium/turf effects, and other situational variables. Each factor has a point-spread–consistent numerical value derived from historical data (1974–2023), where 5 factor points = 1 spread point.
* These game factors fall into three groups: S-factors (special situations), W-factors (weather), and E-factors (emotional). Values are reevaluated annually because trends change. Some factors are fixed; others are “variable” and must be applied based on matchup specifics (e.g., high wind penalizes pass-heavy teams and lowers expected total score). Together, these factors adjust the raw power rating to produce a more accurate prediction for each individual game.
* NFL game prediction uses three groups of game-level adjustments—S-factors (special situations), W-factors (weather), and E-factors (emotional)—each converted into point-spread–consistent values. All factor values are based on long-term historical data and are scaled so that 5 factor points = 1 spread point.

## S-Factors (0.20 per point)
* Situational and scheduling effects: turf mismatches, division games, cross-conference games, primetime schedules (Thu/Sun/Mon), overtime fatigue, bye-week strength, playoff byes, Super Bowl hangover boosts/penalties, travel difficulty, time-zone disadvantages, night-game penalties, multi-week travel burdens, blowout bounce-backs, and matchup-specific adjustments. Some values are fixed; others (e.g., matchup effects) are variable and depend on team strengths.

## W-Factors (0.20 per point)
* Weather adjustments based on temperature, rain, snow, and wind. Warm-weather or dome teams playing in cold outdoor environments incur increasing penalties as temperature drops. Some W-factors depend on quarterback profiles—e.g., QBs who perform better/worse in heat, cold, domes, or precipitation. QB weather modifiers are worth 0.15 points each.

## E-Factors (0.20 per point)
* Emotional/situational considerations such as losing streaks, playoff motivation, coaching changes, roster turmoil, or game importance (as inferred from schedule or media signals).

## Weekly Power Rating Update Formula
* Each team’s power rating is updated weekly using:
* New Rating = 0.90 × Old Rating + 0.10 × True Game Performance Level
*Where True Game Performance Level is:
	1. Net Score(team score minus opponent score)
	2. + Opponent’s old power rating
	3. + Net injury differential (team injuries − opponent injuries)
	Example (Bears vs. Vikings):
	* Net Score: +7
	* Opponent Rating: +4
	* Injury Differential: (3.5 − 1.7) = +1.8
	* True Game Performance = 7 + 4 + 1.8 = 12.8
	* New Rating = 0.90×10 + 0.10×12.8 = 10.28
* The same formula is applied from each team’s perspective.
**Core Concept**
* Game prediction = Power Rating + S-Factors + W-Factors + E-Factors, all expressed in spread-equivalent units. Power ratings evolve weekly based on real performance, opponent strength, and injury context, creating a continuously updated analytical model.

## To calculate a team’s **True Game Performance Level**, combine four components:
1. **Score Differential**
   Team’s points minus opponent’s points.
   (Positive if they won, negative if they lost.)
2. **Opponent’s Power Rating**
   Add the opponent’s old power rating.
3. **Injury Differential**
   Team injury value minus opponent injury value.
   (Positive if the team was more injured, negative if the opponent was more injured.)
4. **Home-Field Adjustment**
   * **Home team:** subtract home-field advantage
   * **Away team:** add home-field advantage

### **Example Calculations**
**Bears (home team):**
True Game = 7 (score) + 4 (opponent rating) + 1.8 (injuries) − 2.0 (home field)
**= 10.8**
**Vikings (away team):**
True Game = −7 (score) + 10 (opponent rating) − 1.8 (injuries) + 2.0 (home field)
**= 3.2**

## Updating Ratings, Applying S/W/E Factors, and Betting Logic

### 1. Updating Weekly Power Ratings
* After computing each team’s True Game Performance Level:
	* New Rating = 0.90 × Old Rating + 0.10 × True Game Performance Level
* Example:
	* Bears: 0.90·10 + 0.10·10.8 = 10.08
	* Vikings: 0.90·4 + 0.10·3.2 = 3.92
* These updated ratings become the baseline for the following week.

### 2. Apply Game Factors (S, W, E) Before Predicting the Next Week
* Each matchup requires adjusting ratings using point-spread-equivalent game factors:
	*5 factor points = 1 spread point
	*S-factors (special/schedule), W-factors (weather), E-factors (emotional/motivation)
* S-Factor Distribution (2022–23 Season)
	*Minimum: 0
	*Maximum: 18
*Average: 3.2 factors per team per week = 0.64 spread points
* Final rating for matchup =
*Adjusted Power Rating = Base Power Rating ± (Game Factors ÷ 5)

### 3. Converting Power Ratings to a Predicted Spread
* Difference in adjusted power ratings → predicted spread.
*Example:
	* Team A = +3
	* Team B = –2
	→ Team A is 5-point favorite

### 4. Betting Strategy Logic
* Bet only when the difference between your predicted spread and the market line is large enough.
* Larger discrepancy → larger bet size.
* Monitor market movement:
	* Line moving toward your side → consider increasing bet slightly.
	* Line moving against you → reduce size.
* Manage bankroll strictly:
	* Bet size is a % of bankroll.
* Bankroll growth automatically scales bet size.

### 5. Relative Value of Key NFL Numbers
* Historical analysis (1974–present) identifies the probability of each margin of victory:
	* 3 is the most critical key number (≈8% of NFL final margins).
	* 7 ≈6%
	* 14 ≈5%
	* Many other numbers have much lower value.

### Practical Rule:
* Bet favorites early, underdogs late.
* Aim to capture or cross through key numbers (3, 7).
* Moving onto/off these numbers gives large statistical advantages.

### Examples:
* If the dog is +6.5 and you like the dog → wait for +7.
* If you like the favorite at –6.5 → bet early before it becomes –7.
* Moves from 7.5 → 7 are highly impactful; moves from 8 → 7 less so.

### 6. Buying Points
* Buying half points usually costs 10 cents ($0.10) per dollar, except around 3 and 7 which are priced higher.
*A “fair price” to buy onto/off key numbers is crucial.
* Only buy points when:
	* Price ≤ fair value in the key-number table.
	* Otherwise, do not buy—stick with the original spread.

## Core Concept Recap
* To forecast games and identify edges:
	1. Update each team’s weekly power rating via the 90/10 formula.
	2. Apply S/W/E factors to adjust ratings for matchup-specific conditions.
	3. Convert adjusted ratings → predicted spread.
	4. Compare predicted spread to market line.
	5. Use key-number probabilities, bankroll rules, and market movement to determine bet sizing and optimal timing.
* This system treats every game as a dynamic equation of power, context, and statistical leverage.

### The Value of Points*

| Point Spread | Chance of Hitting Point Spread (%) | Dollar Value of Buying Half Point ($100 Wager) | Gauging Bet Size (Value of Each Specific Number) |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1  | 3 | 6 | 3 |
| 2  | 3 | 6 | 3 |
| 3  | 8 | 20 off tie, 22 on to tie | 8 |
| 4  | 3 | 6 | 3 |
| 5  | 3 | 6 | 3 |
| 6  | 5 | 10 | 5 |
| 7  | 6 | 13 | 6 |
| 8  | 3 | 6 | 3 |
| 9  | 2 | 3 | 2 |
| 10 | 4 | 9 | 4 |
| 11 | 2 | 5 | 2 |
| 12 | 2 | 4 | 2 |
| 13 | 2 | 5 | 2 |
| 14 | 5 | 11 | 5 |
| 15 | 2 | 5 | 2 |
| 16 | 3 | 6 | 3 |
| 17 | 3 | 6 | 3 |
| 18 | 3 | 6 | 3 |
| 21 | 3 | 6 | 3 |

### **Core Idea**
* Bet strength is determined by the **percentage value of the point numbers** between:
* **Your predicted spread**, and
* **The posted market spread**
* Each point on the number line has an empirically derived probability weight (e.g., 3 = 8%, 6 = 5%, 7 = 6%).
* Add the values of all numbers within the differential to compute the **edge percentage**.
* This edge percentage maps directly to a **star rating**.

## **1. Calculating the Edge Percentage**

### **Rule A — Add point values between predicted spread and market spread**
* Example:
	* Predicted = 7.5, Market = 4.5
	* Numbers crossed = 5, 6, 7
	* Values = 3% + 5% + 6% = **14% edge**
	→ ~3-star play

### **Rule B — Whole numbers count for half value**
*If either number is an exact integer, only count **half** its value.
* Example:
	*Predicted = 4, Market = 2.5
	* Numbers crossed = 3 (full = 8%), 4 (half = 1.5%)
	* Total = **9.5% edge**
	→ ~1.5-star play

### **Rule C — Minimum threshold**
* If combined point value **< 5.5%**, **no bet**.

## **2. Crossing Through Zero (Upset Scenario)**

* When your predicted spread flips the favorite/underdog relative to the market, you are crossing **0**.
**You must subtract the value of one point.**
* Example:
	* Predicted = +1.5, Market = −1.5
	* Numbers crossed = −1 (3%), +1 (3%) → 6%
	* Subtract crossing-0 penalty (3%) → **3%**
	→ **Does NOT qualify** (below 5.5% threshold)

## **3. Star Rating System (Concept)**
* Edge Percentage → Star Rating
	* Low % → 0–1 star
	* Moderate % → 1.5–2.5 stars
	* High % (~14%+) → 3 stars or more
*(Actual table is referenced, but the logic is strict: higher combined percentage = higher stars.)*

## **Machine-Usable Summary**
* To determine bet size:
	1. Compute the spread difference.
	2. Identify every point value between predicted and market spreads.
	3. Add their probability values.
	4. Adjust for whole-number rules (half credit).
	5. Deduct 1 point value when crossing 0.
	6. Ensure the total ≥ 5.5% to qualify as a play.
	7. Map final % to star rating.

### Table 2 – Strength of Play Guidelines  

| Pick Minus Spread | Play Strength |
|------------------|--------------|
| 5.5% | 0.5 Star |
| 7%   | 1.0 Star |
| 9%   | 1.5 Star |
| 11%  | 2.0 Star |
| 13%  | 2.5 Star |
| 15%  | 3.0 Star |

## **Understanding Line Changes**
* Bookmakers sometimes change **price** (vig/juice) instead of changing the **point spread**. This alters the *true* numerical value of the spread.

### **1. Price Changes Alter the Effective Spread**
* If a bookmaker keeps the spread at **3**, but moves the price to **–120**, the actual spread behaves like **3.25**, not 3.
	* Under the Walters system, **3.25 = 25% of the value of 3**, so it counts as **2%** instead of **8%**.
	* You then add the next number in the differential (e.g., 4 = 3%).
	* Total = **5%**, which **does not qualify** for a play (below 5.5%).

### **2. When the Price Is Lower Than Standard**
*If the bookmaker charges less than **–110** (e.g., –105 or +100):
	* The effective spread becomes *smaller*.
	* This increases the value of the differential.
	* Some plays become **stronger** and may qualify as higher star ratings.

### **3. General Rule**
	* **If price > –110**, reduce bet size (effective spread is larger; edge shrinks).
	* **If price < –110**, increase bet size (effective spread is smaller; edge grows).

### **Operational Interpretation**
* The Agent must:
	1. Convert the posted spread + price into an **effective spread number**.
	2. Recalculate the **number-line differential** based on that adjusted spread.
	3. Apply the same point-value system as normal.
	4. Only recommend plays where the final % ≥ **5.5%**.

### How changes in bet price affect implicit spread  

| Posted Spread | Bet Price | Equates to This Spread at 110/100 |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| 2.5 | −115 | 2.625 |
| 3   | +105 | 2.625 |
| 2.5 | −120 | 2.75  |
| 3   | 100 (even money) | 3 |
| 2.5 | −125 | 2.875 |
| 3   | −105 | 3 |
| 3   | −110 | 3 |
| 3   | −115 | 3.125 |
| 3.5 | +105 | 3.125 |
| 3   | −120 | 3.25 |
| 3.5 | 100 (even money) | 3.25 |
| 3   | −125 | 3.375 |
| 3.5 | −105 | 3.375 |
| 7   | 100 (even money) | 6.75 |
| 6.5 | −115 | 6.75 |
| 7   | −105 | 6.875 |
| 6.5 | −120 | 6.875 |
| 7   | −110 | 7 |
| 7.5 | 100 (even money) | 7.25 |
| 7   | −115 | 7.25 |
| 7.5 | −105 | 7.375 |
| 7   | −120 | 7.375 |

## **Moneyline vs. Spread**
* The moneyline is an alternative to point-spread betting.
	* **Favorites** have negative prices (e.g., –158 → risk $158 to win $100).
	* **Underdogs** have positive prices (e.g., +120 → risk $100 to win $120).
	* The point spread does **not** apply when betting the moneyline.

### **Correlation Between Moneyline and Spread**
* Each point spread corresponds to a “fair” moneyline price assuming standard vig (–110).
* Example:
	* Getting **+2 points** is equivalent to a **+108 moneyline** (risk $100 to win $108).

### **Decision Rule**
* If the moneyline offered is **better** than the point-spread equivalent:
	* Prefer the **moneyline** instead of taking points.
* If the moneyline is **worse** than the fair equivalent:
	* Prefer the **spread**.

### **Operational Logic**
	1. Identify the posted point spread.
	2. Convert that spread to its **fair moneyline equivalent** (e.g., +2 → +108).
	3. Compare the actual moneyline being offered.
	4. Choose the option (spread or moneyline) that provides **greater expected value**.
