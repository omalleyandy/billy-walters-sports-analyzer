## Betting Recommendations

### NCAAF Week 14 Strategy
- **Play Top 10 edges** (all MAX BET tier)
- **Unit sizing:** 0.5 units on top 5, 0.25-0.5 on 6-10
- **Avoid games with edge < 10 pts** (too much uncertainty in college)
- **Monitor sharp money** at Action Network for confirmation

### NFL Week 13 Strategy
- **Recommended plays:** 6 confirmed high-confidence edges (Miami, New England, Philadelphia, Denver, Buffalo, Indianapolis)
- **Unit sizing:** 0.5 units on 7+ pt edges, 0.25 on 5-7 pt edges
- **Wait strategy:** Consider holding until complete Week 13 data
- **Conservative approach:** Don't overcommit without full dataset

### Kelly Criterion Application
- **MAX BET (7+ pts):** 5% Kelly
- **STRONG (4-7 pts):** 3% Kelly
- **MODERATE (2-4 pts):** 2% Kelly
- **LEAN (1-2 pts):** 1% Kelly
- **NO PLAY (< 1 pt):** 0% (pass entirely)

## Performance Tracking

### This Week's Goals
- Execute NCAAF Week 14 plays (48 opportunities)
- Track Closing Line Value (CLV) across all picks
- Monitor win % and ROI
- Collect data for season performance review

### Success Metrics
- **CLV Target:** +2 to +5 points per game average
- **ROI Target:** 3-5% (conservative)
- **Win Rate:** 52-55% (not primary metric)
- **Primary Focus:** Consistent +EV, not just wins

## Week-by-Week Adaptability

This analysis uses **automatic week detection** via the season calendar module. The system:

✓ Automatically detects current NFL Week (1-18)
✓ Automatically detects current NCAAF Week (0-14)
✓ Loads correct edge files for identified week
✓ Adapts output and recommendations to current week
✓ Works throughout the season without modification

### How It Works
When you run `/odds-analysis`, the system:
1. Checks today's date
2. Calculates current NFL week (if in season)
3. Calculates current NCAAF week (if in season)
4. Loads edge data for those weeks
5. Generates analysis with week-specific insights
6. Shows data freshness for that week

**No hardcoding needed** - works the same way whether it's Week 1, Week 8, or Week 14.

## Key Principle

> **"Follow the money, not the tickets!"**
>
> — Billy Walters, Professional Gambler

This analysis system follows Billy's methodology: identify where the sharp money (professionals) is going, not where the public (tickets) is betting. When there's a divergence of 5+ points between ticket % and money %, you've found the sharp side.
