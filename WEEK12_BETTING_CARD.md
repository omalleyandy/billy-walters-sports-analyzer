## 📋 BETTING CHEAT SHEET

### **Understanding + and - Signs:**

**+ SIGN (Underdog):**
- Team is GETTING points
- Can LOSE by less than the spread and you WIN
- Example: COLTS +3.5 means Colts can lose by 1, 2, or 3 and you WIN

**- SIGN (Favorite):**
- Team is GIVING points
- Must WIN by MORE than the spread for you to WIN
- Example: RAMS -6.5 means Rams must win by 7 or more for you to WIN

### **Push (Tie):**
- If final score lands exactly on spread, you get money back
- Example: RAMS -6.5, Rams win by exactly 6 = PUSH = Money back
