================================================================================
EXCLUDED BET: CLEVELAND @ LAS VEGAS
================================================================================

Original Edge: 5.8 points (STRONG)
QB Adjustment: Deshaun Watson ruled out, Dorian Thompson-Robinson starting
Adjusted Edge: 2.8 points (WEAK)
Confidence After Adjustment: 34% (BELOW 40% THRESHOLD)

RECOMMENDATION: PASS on this game.

Analysis: The QB downgrade from Watson (Elite) to Thompson-Robinson (UDFA
backup) reduces the edge from 5.8 to 2.8 points (-3.0 point adjustment for
historical precedent). This falls below the 4.0-point STRONG threshold and
drops confidence from 58% to 34%. With six superior edges available at higher
Kelly sizing, this game does not meet minimum thresholds for the betting card.

Market Status: Vegas currently showing -3.5. Expect repricing to -2.5/-3.0 by
Sunday as sharp action accounts for DTR. Monitor opening line Sunday morning.

================================================================================
CLV TRACKING INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

Closing Line Value = Closing Line - Opening Line (for your predicted side)

Example (CAR @ SF, you like SF -7.0):
- Opening Line: -7.0
- Your Pick: San Francisco -7.0
- Closing Line: -4.5 (assumed after sharp action)
- CLV = -4.5 - (-7.0) = +2.5 (favorable movement)

Record for each bet:
[Game] | [Opening] | [Your Pick] | [Closing] | [CLV] | [Result] | [Comment]

This is the KEY METRIC for Billy Walters analysis, not win/loss percentage.
Professional target: +1.5 CLV average
Elite target: +2.0 CLV average

================================================================================
FINAL NOTES
================================================================================

1. DATA QUALITY: All edges based on Overtime.ag API (validated 2025-11-12) and
   proprietary 90/10 power ratings. Market odds reflect live consensus pricing.

2. WEATHER: Outdoor stadiums have weather adjustments applied (wind, temperature).
   Accuracy improves within 12 hours of kickoff.

3. INJURIES: 337 injuries tracked across 14 teams. Position-specific impact
   values applied to edge calculations.

4. SHARP ACTION: Monitor for line movement Sunday morning. Sharp books fade
   public action, so movement direction indicates true consensus.

5. CONFIDENCE SCALING: All confidence percentages assume your closing at
   opening lines. If sharp action moves lines in your favor, CLV improves.

6. QB CHANGES: Cleveland QB transition analyzed separately. Other position
   changes monitored but not major re-rating necessary.

7. NEXT WEEK: Plan to refresh Week 13 data Tuesday/Wednesday. Use same
   methodology for NCAAF analysis (different power rating system).
