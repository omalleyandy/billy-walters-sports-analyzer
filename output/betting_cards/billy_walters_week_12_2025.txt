BETTING CARD SUMMARY
================================================================
Total Recommended Plays: 8
  - MAX (7+ pts): 4 games 🔥
  - STRONG (4-7 pts): 2 games
  - MODERATE (2-4 pts): 2 games
  - LEAN (1-2 pts): 0 games

Total Capital Allocation: 172.7% of bankroll ⚠️
  (Recommended: Scale down to 50% Kelly = 86.4% total)

Expected Portfolio Return (Full Kelly): +126.5%
Expected Portfolio Return (50% Kelly): +63.3%

⚠️ IMPORTANT SIZING NOTES:
The edges this week are UNUSUALLY LARGE (9+ points on top plays).
This suggests either:
  1. Market inefficiency (GOOD - bet aggressively)
  2. Data/model error (BAD - verify before betting)

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
- Verify power ratings are current
- Check injury reports for major updates
- Cross-reference with other models
- Consider 25-50% Kelly sizing instead of full Kelly

INJURY UPDATES
================================================================
⚠️ VERIFY BEFORE BETTING:
Check latest injury reports (11:30 AM ET inactives release)
- Any QB changes significantly impact lines
- Key defensive players affect totals
- Monitor @AdamSchefter, @RapSheet on Twitter

================================================================
BETTING STRATEGY NOTES
================================================================
1. **Line Shopping**: With 8 plays, half-point differences matter
   - Check: DraftKings, FanDuel, MGM, Caesars, BetMGM
   - Save at least 0.5 points on 3 games = Major CLV boost

2. **Timing**: Most games TODAY at 1 PM - limited line shopping time
   - Bet NOW if taking action (lines close in ~3 hours)
   - CAR @ SF is Sunday Night - can monitor afternoon results first

3. **Key Numbers**: DON'T buy through 3 or 7
   - TB @ LAR at -7.0: HOLD (don't go to -7.5)
   - CAR @ SF at +7.0: HOLD (don't drop to +6.5)

4. **Bankroll Management**: 172% total Kelly is TOO AGGRESSIVE
   - Recommend: Use 50% Kelly sizing (divide all units by 2)
   - Adjusted total: 86.4% of bankroll (more manageable)

5. **CLV Tracking**: Record these lines NOW
   - Take screenshots of current lines
   - Compare to closing lines before kickoff
   - Target: +1.5 point CLV average (professional standard)

================================================================
BILLY WALTERS RULES REMINDER
================================================================
✓ Only bet when edge ≥1.5 points (All plays qualify)
✓ Respect position sizing (Consider 50% Kelly this week)
✓ Shop lines at 3+ sportsbooks (Critical with 8 plays)
✓ Track CLV not win/loss (Record lines NOW)
✓ Discipline > Impulse (Verify large edges before betting)

⚠️ SPECIAL NOTE FOR WEEK 12:
Four 9+ point edges is EXTREMELY RARE. This could indicate:
- Major market inefficiency (capitalize!)
- Model/data error (dangerous!)

RECOMMENDATION: Verify with:
1. Check latest power ratings update (when last run?)
2. Verify injury data is current
3. Cross-reference 2-3 other models
4. Start with smaller sizing, increase if edges hold

================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS (Track These!)
================================================================
This Week's Targets:
- Average CLV: +1.5 points (professional)
- Win Rate: 55%+ (not primary metric)
- ROI: 8-12% (Kelly-adjusted)

After Week 12, run:
/clv-tracker --week 12 --compare-closing-lines
