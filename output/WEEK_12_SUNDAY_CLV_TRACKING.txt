================================================================================
MONDAY NIGHT GAME (Not Sunday, but tracked together)
================================================================================

GAME 7: CAROLINA @ SAN FRANCISCO (Monday 20:15 ET)
--------
(Track Monday night - same CLV template as above)

Kickoff: 2025-11-24 20:15 ET
Our Pick: San Francisco -7.0
Edge: 9.8 points (VERY_STRONG - HIGHEST)
Confidence: 98/100
Kelly Sizing: 25.0%
$10k Bankroll (50% Kelly): $1,250 bet

[Use same tracking template as above games]
[Record closing line Monday at 8:10 PM ET]
[Results Tuesday morning]

================================================================================

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:

1. CLV is what matters, not win/loss percentage
   - Professional bettors track CLV, not win rate
   - You can be 45% winners and +2.0 CLV/game profitable
   - You can be 55% winners and -1.0 CLV/game unprofitable

2. Closing line is CRITICAL - set phone reminders
   - Early games: 12:55 PM ET reminder
   - Afternoon: 4:00 PM ET reminder
   - Night game: 8:10 PM ET reminder

3. Sharp action vs public action
   - Sharp books move against public losing action
   - Reverse line movement = smart money fading public
   - Steam moves = sharp action copying sharp action

4. Bankroll management
   - Never exceed Kelly sizing limits
   - 50% Kelly is optimal for most bettors
   - This limits risk while maintaining profitability

5. Next week (Week 13)
   - NCAAF slate: 56 games
   - Run same analysis process
   - Different power rating system (college game)
   - Expected edges may be smaller (fewer data points)
