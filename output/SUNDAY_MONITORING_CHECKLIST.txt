CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
================================================================================

1. OPENING LINES
   - Must capture NOW or tomorrow morning
   - Use consensus market (Overnight.ag primary)
   - Record exact line to nearest 0.5

2. CLOSING LINES (Most Important)
   - Set phone alarms - DON'T MISS THESE
   - Record 5-10 minutes before kickoff
   - These determine your actual CLV
   - This is the difference between +2.0 and -1.0 CLV

3. CLV CALCULATION
   - CLV = Closing - Opening (for your predicted side)
   - This is the ONLY metric that matters
   - Win/loss is secondary to CLV
   - Track it religiously

4. DISCIPLINE
   - Only track the 6 bets you made
   - Monitor Cleveland to validate QB methodology (not a bet)
   - Stick to your Kelly sizing
   - Don't "hedge" or second-guess

5. DOCUMENTATION
   - Fill in WEEK_12_SUNDAY_CLV_TRACKING.txt completely
   - Record observations about sharp action
   - Note any unexpected results
   - This builds your database for future seasons

Six bets + one monitor = Professional approach.
Execute with discipline.

Good luck Sunday.
